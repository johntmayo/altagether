            <h3>Neighborhood Captains</h3>
            <p>Altagether is made up of more than 150 Neighborhood Captains—hyper-local leaders who are organizing their blocks, checking in on neighbors, and working together for collective recovery. Our captains come from every part of the community affected by the Eaton Fire and bring a wide range of perspectives, skills, and passions to their work. Each one organizes in their own way, and together, they form the backbone of Altagether.</p>
