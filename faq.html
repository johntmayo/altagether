                    <p>Each neighborhood can decide how best to stay connected—whether through in-person meetups, text groups, or standing virtual communication—based on the Captain's capacity and the neighborhood's needs.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Designate their own map of neighbors who they would like to be the liaison for</li>
                        <li>Attend a virtual, 1-hour onboarding to be trained in the process</li>
                        <li>Attend a virtual, 1-hour check-in meeting every other week with other Captains to share resources and updates.</li>
                        <li>Participate in a communication network to collaborate and stay informed with other captains</li>

                    <p>Absolutely! Many Neighborhood Captains are themselves displaced by the Eaton Fire. Your firsthand experience navigating displacement can be incredibly valuable to others in similar situations. You can still connect with and support neighbors from your area, even if you're temporarily living elsewhere. In fact, maintaining those connections while displaced can be especially meaningful for both you and your neighbors.</p>

                    <p>Yes please! Renters are vital members of our community and are encouraged to become Neighborhood Captains. Recovery affects everyone in the area, regardless of whether you own or rent. Your perspective and connections as a renter bring important diversity to our network of Captains.</p>
