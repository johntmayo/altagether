		<h3>About Us</h3>
			<p>Altagether is a group of organizers and Altadena residents working to help neighbors connect with each other to navigate all steps of the post-wildfire process, keep residents in Altadena, and work together for collective recovery.</p>
            <p>We use the Neighborhood Captain model to help connect our neighbors to each other.</p>
           <!-- <p>You can help us do this by serving as a Neighborhood Captain. Neighborhood Captains serve as liaisons for their micro-neighborhood and are responsible for connecting with about 40 of their neighbors and ensuring they are supported during this process. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdJ71LUD9B5z-SJQS_gGmbDWWSR1muPfGIDHU8qKGs6mTJzjQ/viewform?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Sign up to be a Neighborhood Captain</a> for your neighbors or to learn more.</p> -->
