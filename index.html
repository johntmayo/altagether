            <p>Following the destruction of the Eaton fire, our goal is to keep residents in Altadena by connecting them with resources and with each other. We are organizing systems for collective recovery and empowering our neighbors to support each other directly throughout the entirety of this disaster.</p>
            <p>You can help us do this by serving as a zone captain. Zone captains serve as liaisons for their micro-neighborhood and are responsible for connecting with about 40 of their neighbors and ensuring they are supported during this process. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdJ71LUD9B5z-SJQS_gGmbDWWSR1muPfGIDHU8qKGs6mTJzjQ/viewform?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Sign up to be a Zone Captain</a> for your neighbors.</p>
