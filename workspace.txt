Altagether is a group of residents and organizers impacted by the Eaton Fire working to connect people, share information and resources, and take collective action.

Our mission is to help residents connect with one another to navigate recovery together, strengthen community bonds, and work collectively for a just and inclusive rebuild. Our approach is twofold: captains connect with their neighbors, trying to bring everyone together; and they connect with each other to collaborate and take collective action.
